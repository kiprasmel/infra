self-host everything.

ever got into actually reading privacy policies of the apps you use?
what about their terms and conditions? (and not just the TL;DRs)

you'd be surprised.


setup
-----

- fork this project to your own
- update relevant variables in ./{local,server}/<project>/vars.sh
- run:

```
./{local,server}/<project>/setup.sh
```

also recommended to fork the forked repositories themselves,
so that you're in full control when updates come in. use:

```
./list-repos-to-fork.sh
```

to get the list.
